# Wolfpack Assessment



## How I did:

I created a fake API in order to work faster towards the solution.

I created an application that shows all information from an API in individual cards, 
and it's possible to update and delete cards.

I implemented this project using React.js, CSS Modules, RESTful API (json-server), React Icons, 
React Tabs, Modern JavaScript, CSS3, HTML3, and Visual Studio Code.

## My inputs:

I had a great time doing this small project. At first, it looks basic but it has
a lot of details.

There are much more improvements that I can do in this project, but due to the time
limit, I decided stopping working on the project in this point.
